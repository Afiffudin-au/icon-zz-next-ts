## Description english

hello programmers! I have a very simple project that is a project that displays a lot of icons, icon packs and can be downloaded. I'm using the API from flaticon.com for data retrieval for my app. My application was made using nextjs typescript, previously this application was made using reactjs typescript. reactjs typescript version at https://github.com/Afiffudin-au/zz-icon (reactjs version).

This application will present content such as icons, icon packs, search icons, search icon packs, icons pages, icon pack pages, details, filters, pagination and others. All of it is wrapped using nextjs framework and it has shown very fast performance.

This version has a few slight improvements:

1. UI
2. Adding filters
3. Performance

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
